# GrubDash Backend

This is an backend API, built with specific routes for the Front End Application, [GrubDash](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/starter-grub-dash-front-end
)


## Learning Objectives
This project tested my ability work to build APIs with complex validation. The key learning objectives include:

- Running tests from the command line
- Using common middleware packages
- Receiving requests through routes
- Accessing relevant information through route parameters
- Building an API following RESTful design principles
- Writing custom middleware functions
